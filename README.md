# Kalman-Filters
Using Kalman Filtering for position estimation within a balloon simulation

## Usage
```
python /Kalman-Filters/main.py
```

### Time Component
1. Please in the future can we have more guidance as to what you want with the
homeworks, since it is time consuming with the vagueness of this specification 
document. This assignment likely took me over 20+ hours to complete due to this fact.
